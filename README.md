- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Justin Tong


- I have worked in the healthcare industry for over five years across almost every health organization
 in the United States (Kaiser Permanente, Oregon Health and Science University, Providence Health and Services, and Legacy Health).
  I'm looking to transition my role from healthcare into the field of data analytics.  I believe I can easily transfer many of my 
skills from healthcare to data analytics (critical thinking, troubleshooting, interpersonal and written communication, presentation skills, research,
attention to detail, and collaboration as a team)


- Iâ€™m currently still learning and perfecting Python, R, Tableau, SQL, and Excel with various projects.  I'm constantly wanting to learn the necessary tools 
for data analytics and want to hone my skills to land a role in data analytics.
